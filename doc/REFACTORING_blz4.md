 **Design Refactoring Report**
 
 **Problem**
 The design issue I addressed was how in one of our simulations, we were using a getColor to identify the cells instead of giving the actual cells a state. As a result, if we changed the colors in the future, we would have had to modify the colors and make sure
 each of the cells were behaving correctly in correspondance to their color. 
 
 **Solution**
 I added the enumerated states for the cells such that we can check their state/modify cells depending on their state rather than color.
